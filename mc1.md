# Mini Challenge 1

Create functional endpoints for updating and eleting tasks.

Each endpoint must be accompanied by:

1. A route definition in 'routes.py'
2. A database function in the 'task.py' module
3. A test utility in 'utils'

### Goal:
To run our flask server and be able to manually test (and see the resulting changes) all of our new endpoints.
